# T2K4E Loot Sheet NPC

This module adds an NPC sheet which can be used for loot containers such as chests or corpses in your game. It has a permission system that allows observers to take loot actions which will automatically process the item transaction. 

### History

This version is based from jopeek's module for DND5E (https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e).

### Features

Allows for easy assembly of items to be distributed to players.

More features detailed below.

#### Permissions
Permissions can be set in the sheet for each player and range from no access (cannot open sheet) or observer (view sheet and contents and utilize loot buttons).
